<h1><b>Methods for JOUR 7800 story on Southwest Georgia health</b></h1>

<h2><em>By Carolyn Crist</em></h2>

<h3>Data file and cleaning:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I downloaded data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, open to public use as part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</li>
<li>Then I sorted through columns and decided which factors and outcomes would be important to feature for my story, particularly in relation to southwest Georgia, major health outcomes, and primary care doctor shortages.</li>
<li>I created a spreadsheet in Google Docs to import the data that I wanted regarding outcomes in each county — particularly percentages of obesity, smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, uninsurance and unemployment. I also included number of primary care doctors and primary care doctor ratio to residents in the county.</li> 
<li>This is a rich data set that needed little cleaning on my end to make it work for the 159 counties. I relabeled the column headers and added “0” for several blanks that needed data in order to show correct correlation in the visualization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Three map visualizations:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>I decided to map all of Georgia’s counties using Google Fusion tables so readers can click through each county and compare. I thought it would be reader-friendly and intuitive for the audience to use.</li>
<li>After importing my chosen data into Google Docs, I found a public Google spreadsheet based on U.S. Census Bureau data that contained U.S. county boundaries and merged it with my spreadsheet based on state and county names. I had to create an additional column to merge the correct properties, using the “&” formula function to combine elements.</li>
<li>I then created three maps based on obesity percentage per county, physical inactivity percentage per county, and the number of primary care physicians per county.</li>
<li>I used a gradient to show the differences among the counties, and all three metrics highlighted the disparity in doctor numbers and severe health outcomes in southern Georgia, particularly the rural parts of southwestern and southeastern Georgia.</li>
<li>I changed the gradient properties to illustrate the differences in a more intuitive way, edited the placard information featured for each county when it is clicked, and updated the legend information to be more understandable for readers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding to my portfolio website:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I published the maps and used the iframe code for the bottom of my portfolio site.</li>
<li>In the iframe code, I changed the height, width, and zoom to make all three fit on one line and inside the boxes as I desired.</li>
<li>I also added style elements to design the simple page with links as desired.</li>
</ul>
