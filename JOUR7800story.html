<h1><b>Southwest Georgia seeks more doctors, stretches programs to serve chronic illnesses</b></h1>

<h2><em>By Carolyn Crist</em></h2>

<p>As university administrators created the new Georgia Regents University-University of Georgia Medical Partnership in 2009, they imagined a program that would help Georgia’s primary care doctor shortage. But when the 37 students in the first graduating class found out their residency assignments in March 2014, only eight were headed to family medicine or internal medicine positions. Of those, only two will remain in Georgia, and they’ll be studying in Atlanta — rather than the state’s southwestern corner where care is needed the most.</p>

<p>Just four days later in March, the Georgia General Assembly sent a bill to Gov. Nathan Deal’s desk that broadens the category of medical students who can receive scholarships. Now osteopathic medical students, who earn an OD rather than an MD degree, will be able to access the medical scholarship and loan program that started in 1952 as a way to expand the number of doctors in Georgia.</p>

<p>As educators and lawmakers try to do their part to bridge the doctor shortage, health clinics and community programs in Southwest Georgia are expanding programs to help the region with the most dire health outcomes in the state. Tucked below Columbus and above Albany, counties such as Terrell, Early, Stewart and Clay respectively rank at 153, 154, 156 and 159 in the state’s 159 counties for health outcomes, according to the latest data released by CountyHealthRankings.org.</p> 

<p>These counties have the highest rates of premature death in the state, meaning potential years of life lost before age 75. The biggest health problems that contribute to this loss of life aren’t surprising — hypertension, diabetes, obesity and heart disease.</p>

<p>“These bubble to the surface in most of the rural communities in Georgia,” said Charles Owens, executive director of the State Office of Rural Health, part of Georgia’s Department of Community Health. “We continue to struggle with these, and though we’ve made progress with various programs, we’ve had varying degrees of success as far as what we’ve been able to tackle.”</p>

<p>Of the 159 counties in Georgia, 109 are considered rural with 1.7 million in population. One of the biggest concerns is the lack of access to doctors for even the most basic health problems. Georgia ranks 39 in the country for the ratio of doctors per 100,000 residents, according to the Georgia Board for Physician Workforce, and threatens to drop to the bottom of the list by 2020.</p>

<p>The group’s report also noted that six counties had zero family medicine doctors, 31 had no internal medicine physicians, and 63 had no pediatricians. In addition, 79 counties didn’t have an OB/GYN, and 66 didn’t have a general surgeon.</p>

<p>“This report further indicates the great demand for primary care in our rural communities,” said Matt Caseman, executive director of the Georgia Rural Health Association, which lobbies for Medicaid reimbursement rates, more primary care opportunities for medical students, and enhanced rural health safety net programs. “We must be aggressive about recruiting and retaining our physicians.”</p>

<p>Federal funding for health centers has trickled into the region in the past few years, and clinics in the region have partnered with the Georgia Association of Primary Health Care to expand their services.</p>

<p>“The clinics are trying to move into the idea of the patient-centered medical home model, with an emphasis on primary care and wellness,” Owens said. “Programs in Southwest Georgia are really focusing on case management for chronically-ill patients dealing with hypertension and diabetes in particular.”</p>

<p>In addition, the SORH is teaming up with groups to establish more small rural clinics to make access more available to residents.</p> 

<p>“Having care close to home is the biggest factor for these health outcomes, and that means training health professionals in this area who will also remain in the area after training,” Owens said. “If patients can easily obtain care and receive it in a way that is affordable, that’s huge, but we need more people going into the rural residency program and staying in the community.”</p>
