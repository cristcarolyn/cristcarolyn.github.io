		<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I’m a freelance journalist based in Athens, Ga., focusing on the intersections among entrepreneurism, narrative storytelling, and data-driven visualization. I’m earning a degree in health and medical journalism but also specialize in business and finance topics. I’ve worked as a crime, education and political reporter for three daily newspapers in Georgia and now write regularly for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Athens Banner-Herald, Flagpole, Georgia Magazine, Newnan-Coweta Magazine and Lake Oconee Living.
